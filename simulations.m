%% Several DGP for portfolio allocation analysis:

% DGP 1: one factor DGP
% DGP 2: two factors DGP
% DGP 3: sin/cos/constant dynamic correlation matrix
% DGP 4: autoregressive correlation process
% DGP 5: scalar DCC correlation process
% DGP 4: vine GARCH correlation process
%% On the selection of the C-vine

% The C-vine can be selected using the following three functions:
% - select_Cvine.m: the method is based on the average conditional
% kendall's tau non-parametric estimator. The method is time-consuming and
% may not be stable when the dimension of the data is larger then 5 or 6
% - select_Cvine_akt.m: selection of the central node according to an
% average Kendall's tau measure (AKT): for each variable returns_k,
% compute its AKT w.r.t. all other variables, where AKT is:
% sum_{1 \leq j \leq N, j \neq k}|\tau_{kj}| with \tau_{kj}
% the Kendall's tau between returns_k and returns_j. Then the variable with
% the highest AKT is selected as the central node of the first tree; the
% central node of the second tree is the variable with the second highest
% AKT. All other central nodes for each vine tree are set according to this
% criterion.
% - select_Cvine_corrcoeff.m: Selection of the central node according to an
% average sample linear correlation measure (ALC): for each variable
% returns_k, compute its AC w.r.t. all other variables, where AC is:
% sum_{1 \leq j \leq N, j \neq k}|\corr_{kj}| with \corr_{kj}
% the sample correlation between returns_k and returns_j. Then the variable
% with the highest AC is selected as the central node of the first tree;
% the central node of the second tree is the variable with the second
% highest AC. All other central nodes for each vine tree are set according
% to this criterion

% Before runing dynamic_vine.m on real/simulated data, the C-vine must be
% selected and the column indices of the data matrix of observations must
% be re-ordered accordingly (this is done by select_Cvine.m,
% select_Cvine_akt.m and select_Cvine_corrcoeff.m)


%% C-vine GARCH model estimation

% - dynamic_vine.m: main function to estimate the C-vine GARCH model, where
% the C-vine has been specified by the user or selected by select_Cvine.m,
% select_Cvine_akt.m or select_Cvine_corrcoeff.m
% If the user has specified the C-vine a priori, the ordering of the data
% matrix of observations is key to run the estimation algorithm: the first
% column will be the root of the first tree, the second column will be the
% root of the second tree given the variable in the first column, the third
% column will be the root in the third tree given the variables in the two
% first columns, etc.
% Full estimation or estimation with truncation can be performed; the
% estimation is performed edge-by-edge in each tree level, which allows to
% employ paraellel computation for each tree vine level: see Section 3.3 of
% Poignard and Fermanian (2019), 'Dynamic asset correlations based on
% vines', Econometric Theory, 35, 167-197
%
% - corr2partial_Cvine.m: performs the mapping from the classic correlation
% matrix to the partial correlation matrix, where the partial correlation
% structure, i.e., the sets of conditioning and conditioned variables are
% given by the C-vine structure, which is deduced from the ordering given
% in the columns of the data matrix of observations
% - partial2corr_Cvine: performs the mapping from the partial correlation
% matrix to the classic correlation matrix, where the partial correlation
% structure, i.e., the sets of conditioning and conditioned variables are
% given by the C-vine structure, which is deduced from the ordering given
% in the columns of the data matrix of observations
%
% - corr2pcorr.m: performs the mapping from the classic correlation
% matrix to the partial correlation matrix, where the partial correlation
% structure, i.e., the sets of conditioning and conditioned variables are
% given by any arbitrary R-vine structure.
% - pcorr2corr.m: performs the mapping from the partial correlation
% matrix to the classic correlation matrix, where the partial correlation
% structure, i.e., the sets of conditioning and conditioned variables are
% given by any arbitrary R-vine structure.
% Both corr2pcorr.m and pcorr2corr.m require the so-called vine array,
% which gives the vine structure. It is a lower triangular
% matrix/triangular array, with non-zero elements below (including) the
% main diogonal
% See the end of this script for examples
% See DiÃŸmann, Brechmann, Czado and Kurowicka (2013), 'Selecting and
% estimating regular vine copulae and application to financial returns',
% CSDA, 59, 52-69, for more details on vine array
%
% On the parameter constraints for each partial correlation processes:
% the user may want to modify vine_constr_tree1.m and vine_contr.m, which
% provide the constraints on the Vine GARCH model. In particular, the
% upper/lower bounds on the constant 'a' and autoregressive parameter 'b'
% may be modified, depending on the dataset.
%% On the DCC model

% The code builds upon the MFE toolbox of K. Sheppard: see
% https://www.kevinsheppard.com/code/matlab/mfe-toolbox/

% The dcc model estimation only is considered (no standard error is
% computed)
